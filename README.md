# Voice Cloning with Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow

This project demonstrates real-time voice cloning using pre-trained models like **Tacotron 2** and **WaveGlow**. You can synthesize speech from text and fine-tune the models for specific voices, accents, emotions, and more.

## Features
- Voice cloning with a short audio clip
- Real-time speech synthesis from text
- Pre-trained models for easy setup
- Easily extendable for voice style transfer (e.g., emotions, accents)

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- CUDA (optional, but recommended for GPU support)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/stan8900/Voicetron.git
cd https://github.com/stan8900/Voicetron.git
```
